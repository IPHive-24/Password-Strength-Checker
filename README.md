<h2>Password-Strength-Checker</h2>
The Password Strength Checker is a web-based application designed to evaluate the strength of user-provided passwords and provide feedback on their security level. The application analyzes various characteristics of passwords, including length, the presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. The application empowers users to make informed decisions when creating or updating their passwords, ultimately enhancing the overall security of their online accounts.

<h2>Key Features</h2>

**Length Analysis:** The application assesses the length of passwords to ensure they meet minimum security requirements. Longer passwords are generally more secure and harder to crack.

**Character Type Analysis:** It evaluates the presence of various character types, including uppercase and lowercase letters, digits (numbers), and special characters (such as symbols and punctuation marks). A diverse combination of character types enhances password complexity and strength.

**Strength Assessment:** Based on the analyzed characteristics, the application determines the overall strength and security level of passwords. It assigns a score or rating to indicate the password's resilience against hacking attempts and brute-force attacks.

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>

**Backend:** Python with Flask framework

**Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (including AJAX for real-time feedback)

**Additional Libraries:** Flask-CORS for handling cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)
